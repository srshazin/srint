# SRint Web Server

Srint web server is an upcoming web server for python. It's designed to keep things simple and modular while keeping optimized for hight efficiency.

I started it as a hobby and experimental project. I started with concurrent socket servers.

### This project is under passive development and is not usable as of right now. Keep an eye on my [twitter/x](https://x.com/srshazin) account for further update.
